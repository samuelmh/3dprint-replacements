# A cap for a square-section tube

2020-OCT-03, _Samuel M.H._


## Description
Few years ago I built a metal table with rectangular tubes. Though I was satisfied with the result and I've used it as my primary workbench, I felt it was a little bit rough. So, I 've managed to design some caps to top off my first real soldering project with some bling and my mark.

## The process
As usual, the first step is to draw a wonderful design with all the specs.

Then I built it with my FDM printer.

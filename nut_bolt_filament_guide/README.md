#  Nut and bolt for Ender 3 3D-printer filament guide.


## Description
This is a nut and a bolt for the [filament guide](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3061551) I use on my Ender 3 3D printer.

As I didn't have the requiered extra metalic pieces, I managed to design and print my own. Now you won't have to go to the hardware store.


## Notes
1. It is incredible the accuracy of this FDM machine.
1. I have used [this library](https://github.com/samuelmh/3dprint-lib_pocs) to design the threading.

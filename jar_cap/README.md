# Wardrobe door stopper

2020-JAN-04, _Samuel M.H._


## Introduction
This is a simple cap for a jar. The original one was made of cork, very old and worn away. 

The interesting part is the engraved name I put on the top that comes from a `.svg` file.


## The process

Basically the piece is a truncated cylinder, no big deal. :)


### Test it!
The problem with this pieces is that although they fit, as the PLA plastic is not elastic, it won't be tight.
To solve it you can use a piece of kitchen paper or a cloth as a seal.
